Player in main menu is in Platformer Mode now!

That mod modify `MenuGameLayer` that being used in `MenuLayer`.
MenuLayer is a 2nd layer that you see when game was just launched.

In `MenuGameLayer::update` method, that calls on every frame, mod freezes background and ground. That can be disabled in settings.
